# **Linked List**

## Introduction
A **`Linked List`** is a linear data structure where elements (nodes) are stored in non-contiguous memory locations. Each node consists of:
- **`Data`**: The actual value stored.
- **`Pointer (next)`**: A reference to the next node in the sequence.

## Types of Linked Lists
1. **`Singly Linked List(Today's Topic)`** - Each node points to the next node.
2. **`Doubly Linked List`** - Each node has two pointers: one to the next node and another to the previous node.
3. **`Circular Linked List`** - The last node points back to the first node, forming a circular structure.

## Operations on Linked List
1. **Insertion**
   - At the beginning
   - At the end
2. **Deletion**
   - From the beginning
   - From the end
3. **Traversal**

## Basic Methods 
- add(e)
- get(i)
- remove()
- clear()
- addFirst()
- addLast()
- and so on
## Advantages of Linked List
- Dynamic size allocation (efficient memory usage).
- Ease of insertion and deletion (no need to shift elements as in arrays).

## Disadvantages of Linked List
- More memory usage (extra pointer per node).
- Slower access (sequential traversal needed).
