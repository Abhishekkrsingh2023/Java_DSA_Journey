# Breadth First Search(BFS)
Breadth First Search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or an arbitrary node in the case of a graph) and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. In the context of a binary tree, BFS visits all the nodes level by level from left to right.
It is also called Level Order Teaversal.
