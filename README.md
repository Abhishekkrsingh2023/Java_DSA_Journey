## 📂 Repository Structure

Each folder (Day1, Day2, ...) contains:
- 📚 Topic(s) covered
- 🧠 Problem statements
- 💻 Code implementations
- 📝 Key insights and learning

## 📅 Daily Folder Structure

Inside each day's folder:

```
/DayX
  ├── Topic.md           // Concepts learned
  ├── Problem1.java      // Problem + Solution
  ├── Problem2.java      // Additional problems
  └── README.md          // (optional) Daily summary
```

**Folder Contents:**
- **`Topic.md`** → Detailed notes and theoretical concepts
- **`*.java`** files → Implementation of problems and solutions
- **`README.md`** (optional) → Brief overview of the day's learning
