# Heap
A Heap is a special tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. There are two types of heaps:

## Types of Heaps

### 1. Max-Heap
In a Max-Heap, the key present at the root node must be the greatest among the keys present at all of its children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that binary tree.

### 2. Min-Heap
In a Min-Heap, the key present at the root node must be the smallest among the keys present at all of its children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that binary tree.
