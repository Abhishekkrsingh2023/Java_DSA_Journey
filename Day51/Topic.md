# Shortest Path Retracing

## Introduction
Shortest path retracing is a fundamental concept in graph theory used to determine the most efficient route between two nodes in a weighted graph. This process is widely applied in network routing, GPS navigation, and optimization problems.

## Algorithm Overview
Dijkstra's Algorithm is a popular approach for finding the shortest path from a source node to a destination node in a graph with non-negative edge weights. The key steps include:

1. **Initialization:** Assign an infinite distance to all nodes except the source, which is set to zero.
2. **Priority Queue:** Use a min-priority queue to process nodes based on the shortest known distance.
3. **Relaxation:** Update neighboring nodes' distances if a shorter path is found.
4. **Parent Tracking:** Maintain a `parent` array to store the previous node in the optimal path.
5. **Path Retracing:** Starting from the destination, backtrack using the `parent` array to reconstruct the shortest path.

## Path Reconstruction
Once Dijkstra's algorithm determines the shortest path distances, the actual path is retraced by:
1. Starting at the destination node.
2. Moving to the node's recorded parent iteratively.
3. Storing the path in reverse order.
4. Finally, reversing the path list to present the correct sequence from source to destination.

## Applications
- **GPS Navigation Systems** (e.g., Google Maps, Waze)
- **AI Pathfinding Algorithms** (e.g., A* in game development)
- **Logistics and Transportation Optimization**
