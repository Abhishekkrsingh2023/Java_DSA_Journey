# Binary Search Tree(BST)
A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:

1. The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node’s key.
2. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
3. Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
