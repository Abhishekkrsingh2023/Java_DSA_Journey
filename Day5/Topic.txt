Topic : Array & ArrayList

Arrays:
An array is a data structure that contains a fixed-size sequential collection of 
elements of the same type. Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, 
instead of declaring separate variables for each value.

Advantages of Arrays:
1. Fast access to elements: Arrays provide O(1) time complexity for accessing elements by index.
2. Memory efficiency: Arrays have a fixed size, which can lead to efficient memory usage.

Limitations of Arrays:
1. Fixed size: Once an array is created, its size cannot be changed. 
   This can lead to wasted memory if the array is not fully utilized or 
   insufficient space if more elements need to be added.
2. Insertion and deletion: Inserting or deleting elements in an array 
   can be time-consuming, as it may require shifting elements.

ArrayLists:
An ArrayList is a resizable array implementation of the List interface in Java. 
It provides dynamic arrays that can grow as needed.

Advantages of ArrayLists:
1. Dynamic size: ArrayLists can grow and shrink in size automatically, providing 
   more flexibility compared to arrays.
2. Ease of use: ArrayLists provide built-in methods for common operations such as adding, 
   removing, and searching for elements.

Limitations of ArrayLists:
1. Performance overhead: ArrayLists have a performance overhead due to the need to 
   resize the underlying array when it becomes full.(Increases Time complexity)
2. Higher memory usage: ArrayLists may use more memory than arrays due to the need to 
   maintain additional information such as the current size and capacity.
   (Generally when the ArrayList is full it Increases its capacity by 2x )

Practice Questions:
1. Write a Java program to create an array of integers and print the elements.
2. Write a Java program to find the maximum and minimum elements in an array.
3. Write a Java program to reverse the elements of an array.
4. Write a Java program to create an ArrayList of strings and add elements to it.
5. Write a Java program to remove an element from an ArrayList by index.
6. Write a Java program to iterate over the elements of an ArrayList using a for-each loop.
7. Write a Java program to convert an ArrayList to an array.
8. Write a Java program to check if an ArrayList contains a specific element.
