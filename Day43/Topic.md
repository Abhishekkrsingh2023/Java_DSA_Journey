# Graph Traversal: BFS and DFS

## Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Explores graph level by level
- Uses a queue data structure
- Visits all neighbors before moving to next level
- Time Complexity: O(V + E)
- Space Complexity: O(V)

### BFS Applications
- Shortest path in unweighted graph
- Level-order traversal
- Peer-to-peer networks
- Web crawlers

## Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Explores as far as possible along each branch
- Uses stack (or recursion)
- Time Complexity: O(V + E)
- Space Complexity: O(V)
