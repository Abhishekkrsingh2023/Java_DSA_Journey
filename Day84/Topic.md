# Day 84: Sliding Window and Two Pointer Techniques

## Problems Solved Today

### 1. Length of Longest Subarray with Sum <= K
- Implemented sliding window approach to find the longest subarray
- Used two pointers to maintain window boundaries
- Optimized solution with O(n) time complexity

### 2. Maximum Points from Cards
- Solved using sliding window technique
- Key concept: Selection of cards from either ends
- Maintained running sum for optimal card selection

### 3. Longest Non-Repeating Substring
- Applied sliding window with HashSet/HashMap
- Tracked character frequencies in current window
- Algorithm to handle duplicate characters efficiently

## Key Learnings
- Sliding window optimization for subarray problems
- Two pointer technique for efficient array traversal
- Space-time complexity trade-offs in window-based solutions

## Complexity Analysis
- Most solutions achieved O(n) time complexity
- Space complexity varies from O(1) to O(k) based on problem requirements
