## Sliding Window
A sliding window is an algorithmic technique that processes data in windows or subsets that move across the data.

### Key Concepts:
- Fixed or variable size window
- Moves from left to right
- Common in array/string problems
- Optimizes time complexity

### Common Use Cases:
1. Finding subarrays
2. Maximum/minimum in subarray
3. String pattern matching

## Two Pointer Technique
Two pointers is a technique where two references traverse an array simultaneously.

### Key Concepts:
- Can move in same/opposite directions
- Often used for sorted arrays
- Space efficient (O(1))

### Common Applications:
1. Finding pairs
2. Merging sorted arrays
3. Palindrome verification

## Time Complexity
- Sliding Window: Usually O(n)
- Two Pointer: Usually O(n)

Both techniques help avoid nested loops and optimize solutions.-+-+-+-+-+
