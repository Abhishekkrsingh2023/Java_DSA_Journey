# Graphs

A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices (or nodes) and edges that connect these vertices. Unlike trees, graphs can have cycles and multiple paths between nodes. Graphs are used to represent networks, social connections, maps, and many other real-world relationships.

### Key characteristics of graphs:
- **`Vertices`** : Points or nodes in the graph
- **`Edges`**: Connections between vertices
- **`Direction`**: Can be directed or undirected
- **`Weight`**: Edges can have weights/costs
