# Day 21: Stack and Its Implementation

## What is a Stack?

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates; you can only take the top plate off the stack.

## Key Operations

1. **Push**: Add an element to the top of the stack.
2. **Pop**: Remove the top element from the stack.
3. **Peek/Top**: Retrieve the top element without removing it.

## Stack Implementation
- Array : fixed size of stack.
- ArrayList : Size increases with increase in elements.
- LinkedList : Most efficient and esay to implement.
