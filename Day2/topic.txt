Today's Topic is Recursion

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself directly or indirectly to solve a problem. 
It is often used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar sub-problems. 
A recursive function typically has two main components:

1. Base Case: The condition under which the recursion ends. This prevents the 
   function from calling itself indefinitely.
2. Recursive Case: The part of the function where the function calls itself with a 
   modified argument, moving towards the base case.
